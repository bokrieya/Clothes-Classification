# Clothes-Classification
This repository uses TensorFlow and Keras to classify clothing items. It includes a simple neural network model for image classification of shirts, pants, shoes, and trousers. The code provides dataset loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. 

# Clothing Classification with TensorFlow and Keras

This repository contains code for an image classification task using the Fashion MNIST dataset with TensorFlow and Keras. The project loads the dataset, normalizes the images, creates a neural network model with three layers, compiles it, and trains it on the training images and labels. The model's performance is evaluated on the test images and labels. Finally, the code predicts and visualizes the classifications for a few test images.

## Introduction

Image classification is a fundamental task in machine learning and computer vision. This project demonstrates how to perform clothing classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset, a popular benchmark dataset in the machine learning community. The dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items in 10 categories.
